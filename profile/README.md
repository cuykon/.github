<h1>What is Cuykon? ðŸ”˜</h1>
<p>Cuykon is an idea born 2 months ago from nothing but with the goal to be funny and playable for everyone. <br> It's a site with a really simple structure (Any Software Engineer could do it in less than 1 hour), but with my medium/low coding <br> knowledge in HTML, CSS and most of all in Javascript this project become better than what my first idea was. â™ª(^âˆ‡^*) </p>
<h1>Why Cuykon? ðŸ¤”</h1>
<p>Cuyk/on, Click on, Quick on, from this words derive the name Cuykon and from a lot of brain storming, of course. All of this idea begin from the fact that the site contain a button and usually when you see one of them you often <i>click on</i> it and you go <i>quick on</i> it to increase the counter faster. Very simple. ^_^</p>
<h3>Hope you Enjoy my Idea and obviusly have fun because it's the reason why I've created all of this! (âœ¿â—•â€¿â—•âœ¿)</h3>
